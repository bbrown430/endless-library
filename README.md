## Known Issues / Shortcomings
- Some .epub files will be rejected when sent to Kindle. I haven't determined what causes some .epubs to be unsupported, but when an error occurs, you will receive an email titled "There was a problem with the document(s) you sent to Kindle." This is not a shortcoming of this program, rather, the Kindle's .epub processing. 
- Email sending only supports Gmail accounts.

## Future Features
- Email support outside of Gmail accounts.
- Documented testing
